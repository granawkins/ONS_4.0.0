# O'Neill Sim

A super-simple space settlement simulator game.

This project is based on the Stanford Torus, as described in Space Settlements: A Design Study: https://github.com/granawkins/ONS_4.0

It was developed by @granawkins as he taught himself to code. As such, it's basically garbage code, but it got him where he is today.

A live version lives at http://oneillsim.com. There are a few YouTube videos about the making of it available at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtPbZSUYCbWGrTliedFIf0AOVhmt8_S27.
